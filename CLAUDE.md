## Testing Policy: Pragmatic TDD

This project follows **Pragmatic TDD** as defined in `docs/testing-pragmatic-tdd.md`.

Before coding any task, declare which testing mode applies (test-first, spike, or characterization) and why. Before finishing, list tests added and what risk they cover.

Default to test-first for domain/business logic. Use spikes only when uncertainty is high — tests must be added before merge.
