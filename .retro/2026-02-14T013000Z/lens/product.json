    "All acceptance criteria delivered: 30+ ACs across 5 stories all implemented. FR4-8, FR11-13, FR56-62 fulfilled. No scope cuts or partial implementations",
    "Full user journeys supported end-to-end: Create recruitment -> list/navigate -> edit details/steps -> invite team -> close recruitment workflow is complete",
    "Ubiquitous language consistently applied: 'Recruitment' (not 'job' or 'position'), 'WorkflowStep' (not 'stage'), 'Member' (not 'participant'), 'Outcome' (not 'result') used consistently across domain, API, and frontend",
    "Default workflow template provides fast start: 7 default steps (Screening through Negotiation) pre-populated in create form, matching domain expert expectations",
    "Creator permanence enforced at all levels: Domain prevents removal, UI disables button, 'Creator' badge displayed — consistent UX"
  ],
  "problems": [
    "Several empty/loading states use basic text instead of shared SkeletonLoader: Story 2.1 M4, Story 2.4 M3 — 'Loading...' text appears instead of skeleton components built in Epic 1",
    "Closed recruitment read-only mode is partial: Edit controls are hidden but read-only display of fields like status is not consistently shown on RecruitmentPage (Story 2.3 M4)",
    "SearchDirectory URL implies recruitment scoping but returns global directory results: This is a confusing API contract that may mislead frontend developers building against the API",
    "No confirmation or undo for member removal: RemoveMember is immediate — no confirmation dialog like CloseRecruitment has"
