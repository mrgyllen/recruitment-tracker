# Epic 5 Demo Walkthrough
**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Stories covered:** 5.1 (Overview API & Data), 5.2 (Overview Dashboard UI)

## Infrastructure Blockers

**API server failed to start.** The .NET 10 runtime (`Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 10.0.0`) is not installed on the host machine. `dotnet run --project api/src/Web` exited with code 150:

```
You must install or update .NET to run this application.
Framework: 'Microsoft.AspNetCore.App', version '10.0.0' (x64)
No frameworks were found.
```

**Frontend server started successfully.** Vite 7.3.1 launched on `http://localhost:5173/` and returned HTTP 200. However, without the API backend, no real data flows can be exercised.

**Docker Compose is available** (`docker-compose.yml` at repo root) providing containerized API + SQL Server. This was delivered as part of `epic-4-deferred-dev-environment` (marked done in sprint-status.yaml). However, the demo requires a running API to exercise the overview endpoints and data flows, which is not possible with `dotnet run` alone on this host.

## Summary
- **Demo method:** BLOCKED -- .NET 10 runtime not installed on host; API cannot start
- **Total ACs:** 16 (7 from Story 5.1 + 9 from Story 5.2)
- **Verified:** 0
- **Blocked:** 16
- **Note:** `epic-4-deferred-dev-environment` was resolved (Docker Compose + MSW browser mode added), but the current host lacks the .NET 10 SDK/runtime, preventing bare-metal `dotnet run`. The containerized path (Docker Compose) would bypass this issue but was not exercised in this demo session.

## AC Inventory (All Blocked)

### Story 5.1: Overview API & Data (7 ACs)

| # | AC Summary | Result | Notes |
|---|-----------|--------|-------|
| 5.1-1 | GET /api/recruitments/{id}/overview returns aggregated data (total count, per-step counts, outcome breakdown, pending count, stale count) | BLOCKED | API not running |
| 5.1-2 | Data aggregated via GROUP BY, response within 500ms | BLOCKED | API not running |
| 5.1-3 | Per-step stale counts included, stale threshold in response | BLOCKED | API not running |
| 5.1-4 | Each step entry includes: name, order, total, pending, per-outcome, stale count | BLOCKED | API not running |
| 5.1-5 | Empty recruitment returns zero counts, all steps still listed | BLOCKED | API not running |
| 5.1-6 | Non-member gets 403 Forbidden | BLOCKED | API not running |
| 5.1-7 | Overview and candidate list endpoints are independent | BLOCKED | API not running |

### Story 5.2: Overview Dashboard UI (9 ACs)

| # | AC Summary | Result | Notes |
|---|-----------|--------|-------|
| 5.2-1 | Overview section visible at top of recruitment page, loads independently from candidate list | BLOCKED | API not running (no data to render) |
| 5.2-2 | KPI cards show total candidates, pending count, stale count; pipeline breakdown shows per-step bar | BLOCKED | API not running |
| 5.2-3 | Collapse toggle hides overview to inline summary bar, state persisted to localStorage | BLOCKED | API not running |
| 5.2-4 | Expand toggle restores full overview from collapsed state | BLOCKED | API not running |
| 5.2-5 | Stale indicator: clock icon + amber, "N candidates > 5 days" text | BLOCKED | API not running |
| 5.2-6 | Clicking step name/count filters candidate list (no page transition, clearable filter) | BLOCKED | API not running |
| 5.2-7 | Clicking stale indicator filters to stale candidates at that step | BLOCKED | API not running |
| 5.2-8 | Recording an outcome refreshes overview via TanStack Query cache invalidation (no loading state) | BLOCKED | API not running |
| 5.2-9 | KPI numbers use 24px bold, StatusBadge component, If Insurance brand palette | BLOCKED | API not running |
