# Pending anti-patterns — added by mini-retro during sprint
# Will be promoted to permanent or removed by autonomous retro

# Story 4.1: M1 — duplicated toStatusVariant() helper in CandidateList.tsx and CandidateDetail.tsx
# Story 4.1: M2 — OutcomeHistoryEntry has recordedByUserId but UI doesn't display "who recorded it" (AC9 partial)
# Story 4.1: M4 — pageSize not included in TanStack Query queryKey (cache invalidation risk)
# Story 4.1: M3 noted but not actionable as anti-pattern (virtualization threshold is a design choice)
# Story 4.2: no new anti-patterns identified (3 Minors are design notes, not recurring patterns)
# Story 4.3: M3 — "who recorded it" not displayed in outcome history (needs user name resolution, not a pattern issue)
# Story 4.3: no new anti-patterns identified (4 Minors are deferred features or design notes)
