# Pending anti-patterns — added by mini-retro during sprint
# Will be promoted to permanent or removed by autonomous retro

# Story 4.1: M1 — duplicated toStatusVariant() helper in CandidateList.tsx and CandidateDetail.tsx
# Story 4.1: M2 — OutcomeHistoryEntry has recordedByUserId but UI doesn't display "who recorded it" (AC9 partial)
# Story 4.1: M4 — pageSize not included in TanStack Query queryKey (cache invalidation risk)
# Story 4.1: M3 noted but not actionable as anti-pattern (virtualization threshold is a design choice)
# Story 4.2: no new anti-patterns identified (3 Minors are design notes, not recurring patterns)
# Story 4.3: M3 — "who recorded it" not displayed in outcome history (needs user name resolution, not a pattern issue)
# Story 4.3: no new anti-patterns identified (4 Minors are deferred features or design notes)
# Story 4.4: M2 — immediate persist instead of delayed 3-second persist with undo (AC5/AC6 simplification, design choice)
# Story 4.4: M3 — panel min widths not enforced below certain thresholds (UX polish)
# Story 4.4: M4 — no loading indicator during outcome recording (optimistic update masks latency)
# Story 4.4: no new anti-patterns identified (I1/I2 fixed in-cycle, M1 keyboard deferred to 4.5, M2-M4 are design notes)
