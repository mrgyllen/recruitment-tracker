# Story 3.1: M1 (missing query validator), M2 (inline closed-check vs EnsureNotClosed), M3 (no query validator tests), M4 (record vs class on commands) — all situational, none warrant regex anti-patterns. M2 is a cross-aggregate case where domain method call is debatable. M4 was prescribed by story spec.
# Story 3.2: C1 (CRITICAL, FIXED) missing auth on GetImportSessionQueryHandler — same pattern as Epic 2 Story 2.3, E-001 experiment did not prevent recurrence. M1-M5 are spec deviations/style, none warrant regex anti-patterns.
# Story 3.3: C1 (CRITICAL, FIXED) matchIndex bug — filtered vs full array index. I1 (IMPORTANT, FIXED) handler missing candidate operations for AC7/AC8. M1-M4 are style/consistency, none warrant regex anti-patterns.
